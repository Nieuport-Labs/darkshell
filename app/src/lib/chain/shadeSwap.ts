/**
 * Just enough of ShadeSwap to turn a token into sSCRT inside another
 * transaction — what auto-refill falls back to when there is no sSCRT to spend.
 *
 * Written against Shade's own client library, shade.js (`msgSwapV2`, the
 * factory and pair queries, the contract registry in its `docs/contracts.md`),
 * rather than depending on it: shade.js brings its own copy of secretjs and
 * rxjs, which is a lot of bundle for three messages.
 *
 * Constant-product pools are priced here: their output is exact arithmetic
 * on the reserves, done in integers, with no request beyond reading them.
 * Stable pools price through an oracle and an iterative solver, and getting
 * that slightly wrong is how a swap fails or overpays — so a route through
 * one is priced by the chain itself, with the router's own `swap_simulation`
 * (`quoteOutSimulated`). Some tokens have no other way in: every ATOM pool
 * with real depth is a stable one.
 *
 * Routes are up to three hops, through any tokens that pair up.
 *
 * Nothing here trusts its own arithmetic with the user's money: every swap
 * carries a minimum return, and the router refuses to trade below it.
